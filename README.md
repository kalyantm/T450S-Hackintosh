My config is heavily inspired by the above config and I looked into it back and forth, especially to get all the patches (Audio, Battery, TrackPad, etc) working. Check the BIOS requirements from that repo, worked well for me.

Even if your config matches mine, I **strongly** recommend you to go through the above guide. It will help you get around a lot of the basics (which are written so well that a total noob like me at the start understood them well)
